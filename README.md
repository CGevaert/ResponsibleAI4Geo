# ResponsibleAI4Geo

## Introduction
This code repository is part of the project *Bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and society: Developing responsible and viable solutions for geospatial data* (with project no. 18091) of the research program Talent Program Veni 2020, which is (partly) financed by the [Dutch Research Council (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en).

## Content of the repository
### Similarity Metric
The similarity metrics used to calculate the coherence between a new testing image and the distribution of landscape metrics within the training dataset. It provides the code utilized in publication [1] below.
